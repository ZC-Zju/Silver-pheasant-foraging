# Silver-pheasant-foraging
The videos show Sliver pheasant's foraging activities in the tree during the daytime. They were shot on August 7, 2019 and July 2, 2020 in the Thousand Island Lake.
Silver pheasant was recorded in this study when they were foraging in groups , the first record showing Silver pheasant can feed in the tree during the daytime. 
Our finding indicates that Silver pheasant has more complex life histories in the arboreal habitats besides roosting in the tree at night.
